I really appreciate you taking the time to review my project (and now I don't feel so awful about it!). Sorry for not taking care to label my charts from the start, I must have gotten carried away plotting them! I've fixed that now. If it is not critical, I will come back to the sections where I could look more into correlation between data points for filling in missing values, as well as to the grouping methods that you suggested (and also check out that heatmap solution for the other part!) in a little bit as I am really pressed on time these few days (and stressed about the hard deadline!). But I read into it and I can see how these are important, so thank you again for pointing these out to me and for all the other amazing tips and links that you left for me, I will definitely apply them in my next project!\n",

    "# Research on car sales ads\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, I'm an analyst at Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on our site every day, and I need to study the data collected over the last year to determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "`price` - price of the advertised vehicle, presumably set by the seller\n",
    "   \n",
    "`model_year` - year produced\n",
    "   \n",
    "`model` -  name of the car brand + specific model\n",
    "   \n",
    "`condition` - condition of the car\n",
    "\n",
    "`cylinders` - number of cylinders\n",
    "\n",
    "`fuel` - type of fuel (gas, diesel, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`odometer` - the mileage of the car at the time of ad publication\n",
    "\n",
    "`transmission` - type of transmission (automatic, manual, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`type` – type of vehicle (sedan, SUV, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`paint_color` - color of the car\n",
    "\n",
    "`is_4wd` - whether the car has a four-wheel drive (Boolean – if not, presumably, two-wheel)\n",
    "\n",
    "`date_posted` - date of ad publication\n",
    "\n",
    "`days_listed` - for how many days the ad was available since published until it was removed\n",
    "\n",
    "How to go about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first: we (first) need to have a good look at the data, see what's in store.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our second step, we'll preprocess the data – find and, if appropriate, fill in the missing values, deal with duplicate entries, rename some columns, change data types to more suitable  where appropriate. Brush up our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding on to the big task, it will be useful to enhance our data a little bit by adding some useful variables or categories, based on what we are provided with. For instance, we can produce addidional columns such as day of the week, month and year (this can be extracted from the date of ad publication), the age of the car at the time of publication, average mileage of the car per year. This will be step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately we want to carry out Exploratory Data Analysis (step 4) to answer the question, what contributes most to a vehicle's price? Does it depend on condition, age, transmission type, or even color? To do this, we will plot histograms and study such parameters as price, vehicle's age when the ad was placed, mileage, number of cylinders, and condition. We'll see if there are any outliers and plot the filtered data again to compare with the previous result. After that we'll look into the lifetime of ads (how many days they were on display). We'll find out the typical length and try to see when the ads were removed too quickly or listed for too long. We'll analyze the number of ads and the average price for each type of vehicle, and try to see if and how the number of ads depends on the type of the car. We'll then select the two most popular types (by number of ads), and study the correlation of factors mentioned above (condition, age, mileage, transmission type, color) with their price.\n"

    "The distinction here is a bit blurry, but from what I understood, these can be similar or even same-looking models, where one can be used for more work-like purposes, say, on a farm, or to carry a lot of weight, essentially for freighting but on a 'small business' scale, and thus its back part can be expanded (even more). Whereas the pickup doesn't get extra space on top of that original extra space at the back, but is enough to use for personal purposes, if those already involve driving a lot of stuff around, but not too much to be needing a truck. It's confusing, and even checking it on Google doesn't give a conclusive answer. On Ford's website f150 is called both a pickup, a truck, and a'pickup truck' on the same page. But the distinction still seems to be there, according to other websites.\n",

    "In order not to overthink this one any further, I propose we treat these categories as legitimate. After all, our own website gave the sellers the option to either call their salvage a truck or a pickup, so that must have been for a reason. Still, it's just good to give extra thought to this, because type is one of the most important categories for the final stages of this report. On the whole, this breakdown by types makes sense – less common and more exotic cars are in lower supply (like vans, buses or convertibles), while SUVs, sedans and pickups are more common, and are therefore more commonly sold."

    "When exploring the dataset, we've noted a few things to keep in mind for the next steps. We saw a lot of missing values in columns that are significant to our task, such as color and model_year, which should help us calculate age of the vehicles at the time of ad posting, as well as cylinders and mileage. The most probable cause of the missing values in this case is the seller forgetting or just omitting these details: after all, on a website like ours ticking all of the details is optional – you have to at least mention the model and type, otherwise it won't attract any attention, but the asker can always ask about the rest of the details in private. We will take a closer look at each of them in the next stage and decide whether and how they can be restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other values such as type and is_4wd the distribution of various categories and division into 4wd/non-4wd looks adequate. SUVs and pickups must be much more in use among common drivers than buses or convertibles, so the data makes sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Same with the models, although the variety of models produced by the same car manufacturer makes it difficult to have a nice overview of them. Perhaps it would be a good idea to categorize them by manufacturer in the future stages. It's not actually needed for our task, but it'd be nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also some faulty data. One example are the years of production (model_year) for some of the cars, such as 1908, which turned out to be plain faulty, not an antique Ford as I thought. I will look deeper into this in the following stage (perhaps we can look at unique values for production years by model or smth like that). There is also some tricky data in price, mileage and days_posted: 1, 0, and 0 for min, respectively, and possible outliers on the max side. More cause to investigate: some of those could be missing values, while others – just outliers. Indeed, 0 in mileage should make sense if the car's condition is 'new', but raise questions if it isn't."

One thing to try is to control for model itself – surely for some models it will be the case that they have a limited range of production years (perhaps because they were released near that year). Another helpful data point in this case would be mileage – how much a car has driven must correlate, although not perfectly, but still – with the car's age. That's assuming the seller is being truthful about it, of course."

    "So I encountered a new problem with this one. The thing is, median, when stuck between two values in an even-numbered array, will resort to mean of the two central values. And that may give us a bunch of 'median' values in place of the missing ones, which normally couldn't occur by design of that column's values. In this case, we would get values like 4.5 or 7 or 9 cylinders, which weren't in the column before (probably because engines with 4.5/7/9 cylinders do not exist!). \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to combine the median and mode functions to get the values that we need. Going through the rows with a loop and checking if the resulting median value strays from the list of unique values in the column will allow us to rely on mode() in that case, which will simply select the most popular value in the group (our next best option where median doesn't work).\n",

Sure enough, it's a bit weird that even some 'salvage'-ranked cars would have 0 mileage, but then, for a small subset of under 200 cars, it could well happen for some strange reason – say, they were parked the entire time and used for storage. Or they were just readings from the odometer (what the column was originally called), which could have been reset at some point for whatever reason. In any case, we can always, and will probably have to, treat them as outliers when it comes to mileage."

    "       \n",
    "As I can see, you tried to apply the grouping method here, ok, it works, but I have some doubts about categorization of the `model_year` because any categorization can lead to simplification of the data. As a whole, here you can use the initial `model_year` column and there is no need to categorize it additionally.\n",

    "Also you can use the combination of `groupby` + transform to fill in missing values by grouping (also you tried to use this appoach)\n",

    "    \n",
    "Filling in missing values with simply a median or mean by a column is a rather risky strategy and is only acceptable for cases where no more than 10% of the data is missing in our dataframe. The risk is that such an approach can lead to distortion of the initial data and, as a result, we will get a biased estimate based on the analysis results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Remember, that it is important not only to fill in the missing values using some method, but also to give arguments why this particular method in this particular case is adequate and correct. And it is better to connect the strategy you choose for filling in missing values with the hypotheses about why there are missing values in the data, why they occur."

    "- `mileage`: here we too don't really need that precision to meters or just extra zero digits after the dot for whole numbers, so we can convert these to integers\n",
    "\n",
    "- `is_4wd`: this column evidently must contain the boolean values for whether the car is a 4wd or not, so the half of it that's denoted as missing values (nan) is probably an accidental by-product opposed to the other half of values noted as 1 for 'True'. We can change all values to bools and present them as ints so that they will be 1's and 0's\n",

    "We started out with a dataset that had about 15% values missing in mileage and 7% in model_year, which are significant numbers, and important data points for later analysis. Besides that there were also missing values in cylinders and color. We managed to restore missing values for mileage and model_year in line with the median values for the respective models and prices, where appropriate. This will help make sure that we have enough data to go by when we get to analysing prices by types or some other categorical breakdown, so this is good – we want to be sure we're not missing out on important data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using histograms to visualise data and compare the results of data manipulation at preprocessing stage proved to be useful: when restoring values in so many rows, just looking at the graphs helped ensure that the resulting distribution is in line with what was observed in the beginning. If our 'model' for restoring the values was off, this would have been spotted instantly on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing more 'routine' operations like changing data types where appropriate we also make sure that the data is completely ready for further calculations, additions and analysis, that will follow in the next steps. It's useful not to have to think about it, and actually feels like a large part of the work is already complete. What helps even more is the deeper familiarity with the data that is acquired at this stage, even simply as observations: for example, it helps to keep in mind that in some rows the zeros I will encounter later are (likely) not missing values, but are just the lowest values. And I also got the feel for the possible errors and outliers in the data (like with model_year). \n",
    "\n",
    "It also doesn't hurt to adjust the data we're working with a bit to make it more comprehensible – like when we don't need to stumnle over 'odometer' and 'paint_color' every time, and instead use more straightforward names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping up, the work done at this stage sets me up nicely for making additional calculations based on model_year and mileage in the next stage."

    "So we'll have some values for age that will be equal to zero, and I propose that the easiest way is to just treat those as 'less than a year old' – to me it makes sense. If a car hasn't reached a full year of age at the time it was posted, then it shouldn't fall into the category '1 year' (or older..). Let's just make sure that these values correspond. The number of zeros values should be roughly the same as what was posted for sale in 2018 or 2019. Some, that were produced in 2018 (remember that all cars are assumed to be produced on the 1st of January: any other date would be just as arbitrary), but were posted later than that in the early months of 2019, will have the value of 1 in age."

    "Adding necessary categories such age and miles_per_year, as well as day/week/year of publication was relatively straightforward, but different kinds of data require different approaches, and it was useful to keep in mind the particular features of different values – for instance, to return total_miles in case the age of the car was less than one full year (so as not to accidentally divide by zero). So I used an apply function approach there, whereas for making the age column it was enough to simply create a new column based on values in the other ones. A similar approach for extracting day/wee/year – but with the added convenience of being able to extract them as attributes of datetime values. \n",
    "\n",
    "When proceeding with steps in preprocessing or 'enhancing' data, it's useful to keep in mind what different values might mean – for instance, getting 0 for age might appear confusing at first glance, but with a simple check it was possible to ensure that they are just a result of cars being produced in recent years, not clocking in 1 full year of age. At least, it's a valid enough distinction to make in the absence of 'month of production'. "

Either way, we see no Lamborghinis in this data slice, and we can definitely treat these as outliers."

    "The data is till 'skewed' to the left, but slightly more readable. We can see a 'chainsaw' pattern with these spikes that go up near round values. I think that one possible explanation is psychological in the sense that when putting a numerical estimate on something, people tend to opt for round values, like \"I want to sell this item for 20 or 25 dollars, not 22 or 23\". This could also happen in this case, with sellers going for values divisible by 1000, 500, 250 or 100."

Let's do another one with fewer bins."

    "Hmm. Doesn't look like a mistake in anything we've done in our calculations and changes to the table. The model year came with the data, as was the date when the ad was posted. Yet those cars have some mileage behind them somehow. So it could either be a technical error in the data exporting process or a typo by the seller. They all have 2019 as model_year and yet they posted their ads in the year before that. I think a reasonable option is drop these 6 rows, since we can't really fix the dates, and these are clearly erroneous values."

Even though the total amount of other numbers of cylinders combined is very small, it seems to me unreasonable to exclude them from the analysis as outliers, after all these are categorical values which are rare, not numerical values that stray from the rest for a weird reason (like a ridiculously high price or a hundred years in service). Either way due to their relatively small weight they shouldn't distort our analysis."

In other words, it probably takes some time before the deal is complete and the ad can be removed. Of course it could also be that the seller finds their buyer from a different source (word of mouth / different website) on the same day or a couple days after they post the ad, and so they remove it very quickly. But then again, that also makes it less relevant for us.\n",

    "Interesting! We can see that pickups and trucks seem to be, on average, the most expensive. Cars like sedan, which imply a simpler complexion and less power than most other categories like SUVs, mini-vans, pickups and others, are cheaper too, so that makes sense. We can also see that there does seem to be a distinction between trucks and pickups after all: if our earlier assumption about trucks being slightly more powerful is right, then that should justify a higher median price for them. We should be wary about some of the values plotted above, however: remember that despite buses' impressive price range, they are a vanishingly small sample – only 24 or so. That's likely the reason why boxplotting their prices doesn't really give us meaningful graphical representation in terms of evaluating where a whisker should be, so it just lands on the highest value, leaving no outliers."

But it helps that we have count plotted on the same graph: the ratio of blue to brown SUVs seems to be about 3:1, so I assume in the case of this two colors at least, it wouldn't be wise to make predictions."

   "source": [
    "From what we have seen, age and mileage appear to be the factors most correlated with price of a car in our dataset. It's helpful to have all types of graphs that are appropriate for the types of data involved, as they can help us see the relationship in a more rounded way. For instance, we can definitely see the relationship by how curved the line is if we plot median values, as opposed to a proper scatterplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between age and mileage and price is exactly what one would expect: the newer the car, the better its value on the market. And we could easily expect in 9 cases out of 10 for mileage to be closely correlated with age, for obvious reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a little more puzzling to see that the corr() coefficient for condition and price appears to be two times weaker than for mileage or age, even though we can see the relationship more or less clearly on the graph. Remember that our condition scale goes from 0 to 5 where 0 is salvage and 5 is (supposedly) new. For each of the 4 categories in between there appears to be a clear progression of these data points intersecting more often with higher values for price. I think there are two reasons for that (for the weaker correlation). Firstly, condition being a categorical value, we had to use boxplot, which is helpful, but a little deceiving in that it is easy to spot the progression, which is there, but harder to remind yourself that the boxes' ranges actually still overlap for (what looks like) the most part. After all, there are only so many conditions (6, or 4 with enough data to estimate correlation), and they inevitably capture a wider range of prices. The second reason for that is that condition, as it is originally collected and reflected in our dataset, is not as precise and reliable a value as mileage and age of the car, but is decided upon by the seller and is wildly subjective compared to the reading of the car's odometer. Perhaps if there was some kind of a precise condition index, computed based on age, mileage, number and severity of scratches, repairs, recorded accidents and so on, it would actually correlate with the price much more strongly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Transmission is a category for which we have disproportionate amount of data for the two types (automatic and manual), and too little data for mixed transmission, to see a difference in relationship. Based on the data we have, however, there is a difference for sedans and SUVs: it's quite self-explanatory for sedans that manual transmission cars are in most cases the more outdated models, and since they are not as well suited for the most drivers' purposes, they are less in demand. Therefore their median price is a couple thousand lower. With SUVs the opposite appears to be the case: they are at least two thousand or so more expensive, judging by the median value (however it is clear from the graph that most of their price values are, in fact, in the same range). If a corr() value could be computed for transmission and price, I wouldn't expect it to be very high, since the two values (if we don't count the mixed type), cover almost every other possible combination of factors. But I suppose it makes sense that manual transmission is more suited for some people's purposes and demands from a car. Since it implies more precise control over transmission, it may well be something that could be valuable to SUV owners more often, so for that type of car it's more a valuable feature, than a useless and cumbersome transmission mechanism, as it is likely perceived by unassuming sedan-owning city drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For colors it's bit more tricky, since we can definitely guess that color is a factor that likely doesn't determine a car's price directly, but can rather be associated with a set of other features that do that. For instance, red or yellow could in some cases be disproportionately more popular with some kind of expensive sportcar-like vehicles. Whilst black could more often be the color of choice for 'representative' class sedans and SUVs purchased by corporations or used by government officials, or something else like that. For our dataset, it is most likely the case that black (along with white and silver) are simply the most popular color in general and therefore capture a wider price range. My subjective guess for the rest of the colors would be that such colors as green or brown could be associated with older cars, and purple is...priceless. There is the weird case of orange color being wildly outside the range, both for SUVs and sedans. I really struggle to think of a reason for that. I even struggle to remember the last time I have seen an orange car. But I think it's safe to assume this is a case of some local outlier values, because there are still only 80 of those cars in the case of SUVs, and less than 50 among sedans. If one looks at the data for those sedans though, one will see some fancy and pretty expensive Dodge cars, that look like sportcars to me. Case in point: it's a small selection and wacky color for most people, but it looks well on a limited selection of cars that happen to be more expensive."

    "The data that we received for the listings on our website was quite broad. It doesn't appear to have any duplicated rows, which made the initital steps easier to an extent, but it would be a good idea to consider including some kind of a unique identifier per user in the future, which would enable the analyst to parse the listings better, because it is not certain that some cars wouldn't be listed twice or more times, but it would be difficult to spot them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing the data made me discover the relationship between different parts of the dataset. For example, in order to restore a (substantial) number of missing values in model_year, I first remembered that age of the car is something that I'll need to explore deeper further on, and so I really did need to restore them, and secondly considered how that might depend on other data points such as model of the car and its mileage. This call seems to have been proven right in the end, judging by how similar the correlation coefficient is for age and mileage when measured against price. This time I could use the advantages of corr function and plots like histogram at preprocessing stage to see whether my assumptions check out. I also encountered new difficulties, for instance when trying to restore values for cylinders, which is really a categorical values, although expressed numerically – but I was able to come up with a relatively simple function that applied mode that doesn't return incorrect values (which the programme doesn't know are incorrect). Another one was color: a substantial number of values were missing, and I had to make a call not to restore them, because to the best of my judgement, I couldn't see a way how to restore them so that it made sense, and so I decided to pack them into 'unknown' category. \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering which data to use, I decided to trust the distribution as exhibited in a boxplot, in order to cut at the points where outliers begin. However, again, in most cases, it helps to study the data a bit deeper and see whether it will actually make sense to slice out large chunks of it, and to think of the implications – I will make sure to consider this in the future. One case in point is when measuring outliers in such numerical categories as mileage. Surely there is not much use in entries below a thousand miles if they do not add up to a substantial percentage of the dataset. But then we have cars that are listed as brand new or almost new, and slicing out that subset could mean distorting the distribution of conditions of cars in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that most of our cars were advertised for about a month before being sold (presumably?). Of course we don't have enough data to think why exactly a listing could go down. Although it could be gathered in the future by asking users to fill out surveys perhaps. Otherwise we don't really have enough data to judge as to why an ad could be removed on the first day or during the first week. Personally, such sales appear to be too quick to me. But generally, the majority of our ads stayed up from a week to 3 months or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price of the cars, it appears, it mostly correlated with age and mileage (which in turn correlate with each other). It is pretty straightforward: newer, less 'worn out' cars are sold at a higher price. This is true across types (we studied it using the examples of SUVs and sedans). However, when it comes to other characteristics like transmission and color, and even condidion (to an extent), they have a different relationship with price depending on the type of vehicle. This could be explained by the purposes for which people own cars, as well as by somewhat idiosyncratic factors like certain models just being popular in signature colors (like orange). On a methodological note, it helps using a variety of plot types to study these relationships, but we should always keep in mind the size of our samples, like with wacky colors or curved lines when plotting median values."
