So it's confirmed: all the values in the normal range seem to have been exported as negatives, whereas the abnormally high values came positive."

    "Looks like we conditions in my function were too strict for these five entries: as we see above, there were no similar rows for them that contained a day_employed value, so nothing to make a median value from. It would be best to tweak the function a little bit to account for such cases, so let me try to do it below. I would argue that for these 5 cases we can base the median value on age and gender, excluding the income_type. The reason for that is that for some combinations of age and gender, there is only one person of a certain income_type (like with that 24-y.o. retiree, which in itself is interesting). And then, for entrepreneur, there are only two entries in total."

    "So we can see that this is someone who has started working at a relatively young age, received some college education, and likely runs their own business making a decent total income, whilst being in a civil partnership. XNA is a standard for marking a missing gender value as unknown. It is unlikely to be a case of someone consciously refusing to state their gender or choosing 'prefer not to say', because in that case there would likely be more than a single XNA. However, it seems to me that in this particular case it is unnecessary to try to fill in the missing value, since there is nothing to really give us a clue one way or the other regarding the person's gender. Since it is just one value, and doesn't really affect our project's task, I would simply leave it as it is."

    "So by going over each column from the beginning looking at value_counts, we discovered that there were missing values in days_employed as well as in total_income. There were also the hidden missing values for age – zeros, and one missing value for gender, marked as XNA. In the case of gender, I decided it best to just leave it in place, because filling in that value based on other data would seem to be pure guesswork. On second reflection, remembering the proportion of females to males in our dataset, I think the only other option would be to just assume it's female – but it too would be a stretch. \n",
    "\n",
    "For age, days_employed and total_income I had to rely on other data to fill in the missing values. It could be argued that the missing values in age are not that important to the dataset in terms of size, but it was still good practice. It also helped me notice the difference in data between females and males, which is important to consider. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of days_employed (as with total_income), the amount of rows with missing values was 2174, which is just over 10% of the total amount of rows. Considering that both of these are not pertinent to the main questions of the project task, someone could possibly argue in favour of dropping them. But at the same time, these same rows contain 10% of those who have previously defaulted on their debts – and this column, in turn, is essential to our project's task. So this should tell us that dropping these rows is not a good option.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fill in the missing values for days_employed I used median values of days_employed depending on gender, age and income_type. The reason for using age is pretty obvious – we don't want to end up with more days_employed than \"days lived\", so it's important to control for that. By considering gender, we accounted for the fact that females in the same occupation and age seem to have spent a few days less employed – this could happen for a number of reasons such as more common maternity leave. And by controlling for income_type, we additionally accounted for the differences in days_employed that are observed between business owners, civil servants, employees and retirees. Retirees especially seems to have a well-defined range of days_employed, therefore controlling for this should help keep our data consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the missing values for total_income and days_employed occured in the same rows, these two are an example of categories that don't really affect one another, and we saw this in the data. It seems to suggest that total_income records yearly income, which rather depends on the income_type as well as gender, and less so on age. While the gender pay gap that we saw reflects some pretty global societal issues, it's also important for keeping the data consistent. Controlling for income_type, in turn, helped us spot the difference between 'business' and 'entrepreneur', even though there are only two of the latter type in our dataset."

Education was a bit easier to deal with technically – it was enough to just bring all values to lowercase to have them normalised – now they are distinct categorical values meaning different things, which is much better. We can see clearly how many have which education.\n",

It could be the result of a customer stating the purpose of the loan or a bank clerk entering the data manually every time. It could be useful to apply stemming or lemmatization techniques in order to deal with these values, but honestly it seemed like for the purpose of this dataset, and looking over value_counts, it was much quicker to do this one 'by hand' – and it worked."

Whereas those who are married and have children, have a default rate that's even slightly above our dataset's average. Those who are not marrie and have kids are the most likely to default, it seems. Also, not having kids in a marriage speaks to higher financial dependency than not having kids and not being married...oh wait, we got that from the first pivot table..."

The default rate of 6,2% for the lowest-income group should be treated with caution, however, and that group should be investigated further. In any case, it is also a much smaller data sample compared to the other income level groups."

    "Different financial commitments behind taking out the loan fare differently, as we can see from the default rates by purpose. It looks like car purchases are the most unreliable in terms of the probability of non-repayment, at 9.3%. Education comes second, which is somewhat surprising, and wedding ceremony comes third. It looks like it did make sense in the end to separate commercial real estate dealings from people trying to get a house for themselves – we can see how the default rate for them is different, with a difference of roughly 0.7% in favour of just housing."

    "So we can see that the goal of taking out a loan can indeed be a predictor of whether you'll be able to repay it. One is most likely to default on a loan when needing it to buy a car, and quite likely when needing the money to pay for education. This last one is a surprising result for me, because intuitively it would seem that people who are taking out a loan to invest in their own 'human capital' have got to be the most promising of the bunch (in terms of financial dependency), so there must be reasons why this is not the case. This could be a reflection of macroeconomic reality to some degree, when a job market in a specific area is overly saturated or there is a recession and many graduates end up without a job. In the U.S., for example, education loans are notoriously crippling, and people end paying these out over many years or even decades – indeed, on some terms, they may even default on them after an expiration deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wedding ceremony result is a bit surprising from a subjective point of view, because in many eastern european countries a lot of people tend to take out massive loans for the festivities, which they cannot afford – it's a well-documented phenomenon. So I was expecting the default rate there to be higher, but I'm glad to be proven wrong. Somewhat surpisingly, people who take out loans to get their own house have turned out to be the most reliable in our dataset, considering this kind of expenditure has got be the largest one among those spent on personal needs. By way of an educated guess, I'd say this could be due to the fact, that one has to show more 'down payment', so to speak, in advance in order to be assessed as likely to pay our quarterly or monthly mortgage installments on time, and so have more income or savings or a good track record beforehand. Commercial housing which is essentially more of a business loan is a close second, which could tell us that people who come forward having thought through their business scheme can be more relied upon to repay that loan (for the most part)."

    "The dataset that was provided didn't have any explicit duplicate values, and only had a chunk of explicitly missing values, that occured in the same rows for days_employed and total_income. Since total_income was pertinent to one of the questions, it had to be dealth with. By examining the data I realized that total_income depended for the most part on the income_type, so I used that in order to fill that in with median values. Thanks to the breadth of the data that I had, I was able to see that it's important to just have a general look at the values first and to play around with the dataset. This made me think twice before just filling in the missing data with median values based on, say, everyone's income, because I saw that it was different depending on gender, among other things. This is a fruitful observation that must have helped in not skewing the resulting stats too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue was the days_employed, which was not helpfully presented, and turned to have a chunk of data that was corrupted, and must have been imported in hours, while the rest of the values had a minus sign. Even though this column wasn't instrumental to the questions, it was helpful to get it in order. Indeed, as a result of further categorizing that data, if we make a pivot table, we will see some substantial differences based on length of work experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would suggest to the client to consider carefully which factors to take into account when creating the credit rating score. Even though some of the data that we had, like days_employed, might seem irrelevant to the task at hand, it may in fact be helpful. Another thing I would suggest to do in the future is try to collect more data on different working experience as well as income type groups, so we have more instances of every group and can make more statistically sound conclusions for them."
